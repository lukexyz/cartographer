/*
    This portion of the script can only be generated procedurally outside the AoE2 program.
    The large number of layouts is responsible for the large script size.
    In order to save space, these commands rely on the default values.
        base_size is 3
        terrain is GRASS (DS_T_DEFAULT)
    Ideally, there would be a unique configuration for each map size, but that would
        use more space. AoE2 parses this file very very slowly, so space is limited.
