	Max results in some canyons 100% of the time.
		It's a roughly 75-25 split between a depth of 4 and a depth of 2.
 	Med results in no canyons about 25% the time.
 		The other 75%, it's always a depth of 2.

	Ideally, there could be a whole range of options for canyon depth,

	You could predetermine a depth or two for each layout,
		but then that layout would always have the same range,
		which (in rare instances) would leak information about which layout was chosen.
