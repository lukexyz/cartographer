/*
	This ended up only getting used for a single layout.
		After all the layout filtering and sorting and selection of the best maps, only
		one "loop route" had enough balance or geometry variance to score high enough to
		be included according to the algorithms used.
		Loops would have been excluded because they did not have enough space for
			8 players. Also, they would get excluded if other "similar" layouts scored
			higher (similarity is based sharing most of the lakes + player spots).
	
	The idea is to increase the randomness without increasing the script size
		by randomly removing one segment (connecting 2 lakes) of a river that
		forms a complete loop. All lakes are still connected, but sometimes you
		have to visit each lake to travel from the "first" one to the "last" one.
